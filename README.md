# Python


## **Description**
#### What do I do here?
I create original pieces of code written mainly in the language of Python to share.
#### What technologies did I use?
I use an IDE, PyCharm. This is because it has a great project management system and is friendly to beginners (like me)!

## **Installation**
#### Is there any installation process?
No, this is because all programs here are **NOT** softwares or apps. These codes are simply raw pieces of Python code. However, you may need a special program to run Python. For long term use, I would recommend PyCharm. If you just want to run code without going through the faffle of installing IDE software apps, I recommend replit on a web browser. Here are some links:
- Computer Program: [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
- Computer Program: [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/download)
- Computer Program: [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Web Browser: [Replit.com](https://replit.com/~) _**Remember, this is a free browser program. Just create a free lifetime account._

## **Using the Projects**
#### How to use projects?
Just run it. Again, these are dead simple pieces of raw code. They have no graphics user interface and is extremely easy to use with the programs listed above.

## **Contribution**
#### How can you contribute to a project?
Simple. Just email me. I will have a look at your profile page and send you an invitation link. 
#### Are there any requirements for contributors?
No, of course not! Who would I be to judge whether you should be able to contribute to the project. Just politely email me and I would happily accept your help. I am determined to set everybody as equals to make this code as good as possible.
#### What are the rules for contributing?
Just don't mess around with the files. Remember that you may be held responsible for sabotage of any sort.

I am open to people copying my code and improving it. Just link me to the project. 

However, please do not just take my code and claim it's yours.

I am looking forward to making the world work better with my code. My code is also not perfect, so please be comfortable to open issues or contact me: *mtytteacher@gmail.com*
