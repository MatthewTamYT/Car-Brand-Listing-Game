## **Description**
#### What does the application do?
The application is a listing game. In this game, you have to try list 30 car brands out of the available 50 to win.
#### What technologies did I use?
I used Python because it is easy-to-use. It delivers my purpose through straight forward lines of code. I also used an IDE, PyCharm. This is because it has a great project management system and is friendly to beginners (like me)!
#### What challenges did I face?
I face many challenges. Because this is one of the rather complex piece of code I have written, I often confuse variables and loops. This caused many errors which I later fixed during the vigorous testing phase. I also struggled with popping the inputted value from one list to another, but eventually, I managed to see light at the end of the tunnel.

## **Installation**
#### Is there any installation process?
No, this is because this game is **NOT** a software or an app. This game is simply a raw piece of Python code. However, you may need a special program to run Python. For long term use, I would recommend PyCharm. If you just want to run this code without going through the faffle of installing IDE software apps, I recommend replit on a web browser. Here are some links:
- Computer Program: [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)
- Computer Program: [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/download)
- Computer Program: [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Web Browser: [Replit.com](https://replit.com/~) _**Remember, this is a free browser program. Just create a free lifetime account._

## **Using the Project**
#### How to use the project?
Just run it. Again, this is a dead simple piece of raw code. It has no graphics user interface (at least not yet) and is extremely easy to use with the programs listed above.

## **Contribution**
#### How can you contribute to the project?
Simple. Just email me. I will have a look at your profile page and send you an invitation link. 
#### Are there any requirements for contributors?
No, of course not! Who would I be to judge whether you should be able to contribute to the project. Just politely email me and I would happily accept your help. I am determined to set everybody as equals to make this code as good as possible.
#### What are the rules for contributing?
Just don't mess around with the files. Remember that you may be held responsible for sabotage of any sort.

## **Project Features**
#### What car brands are there?
I chose the ones that I thought would be most well known to people, not the most common cars we see on the roads. For example, Lamborghinis aren't the Top 50 car brands sold in many places, but it is one of the most well known car brands, so I included it.
#### Can you cheat?
Prevention measures have been created to prevent user from inputting nonsense answers or repeating previous entries. Of course, you are free to edit the code after you downloaded another copy, where I cannot stop you from deleting the measures.

## **To-Do List**
- [x] Thorough code testing. ðŸ’»
- [ ] Refactor the code. ðŸ’¾
- [ ] Make the experience better. ðŸ“·
- [ ] Improve appearance. ðŸŒ»
